        <p>Hello, Gophers! Welcome to Part 2 of Data Structures and Algorithms. If you&rsquo;ve missed
Part 1 on Big O, you can read it
<a href="https://blog.mikesahari.com/posts/dsa-part1-big-o/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Data structures form the foundation of computer scienceâ€”they&rsquo;re how we organize, store,
and manipulate information in ways that mirror how we think and solve problems. Far
beyond mere implementation details, these abstractions shape how we conceptualize
computational challenges. Whether you&rsquo;re building a search engine indexing billions of
webpages, an operating system managing memory resources, or a mobile app tracking user
interactions, choosing the right data structure can mean the difference between a
solution that scales gracefully and one that becomes that legacy tech debt app that
engineers share stories about, blaming the original designer (you know who you are).</p>

        <p>If you&rsquo;ve been diving into Go programming (or &ldquo;Golang&rdquo; as the cool kids say), you&rsquo;ve definitely encountered structs. They&rsquo;re absolutely fundamental to how we organize and work with data in Go, and mastering them is crucial to writing clean, efficient Go code.</p>
<p>I like to teach about structs, like other fundamentals, because of how powerful structs can be when used properly. Let&rsquo;s break down everything you need to know about structs, from the very basics to some advanced patterns I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way.</p>
