        <p>Hello, Gophers! Welcome to Part 2 of Data Structures and Algorithms. If you&rsquo;ve missed Part 1 on Big
O, you can read it <a href="https://blog.mikesahari.com/posts/dsa-part1-big-o/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Data structures form the foundation of computer science—they&rsquo;re how we organize, store, and
manipulate information in ways that mirror how we think and solve problems. Far beyond mere
implementation details, these abstractions shape how we conceptualize computational challenges.
Whether you&rsquo;re building a search engine indexing billions of webpages, an operating system managing
memory resources, or a mobile app tracking user interactions, choosing the right data structure can
mean the difference between a solution that scales gracefully and one that becomes that legacy tech
debt app that engineers share stories about, blaming the original designer (you know who you are).</p>

        <p>If you&rsquo;ve been diving into Go programming (or &ldquo;Golang&rdquo; as the cool kids say), you&rsquo;ve definitely
encountered structs. They&rsquo;re absolutely fundamental to how we organize and work with data in Go, and
mastering them is crucial to writing clean, efficient Go code.</p>
<p>I like to teach about structs, like other fundamentals, because of how powerful structs can be when
used properly. Let&rsquo;s break down everything you need to know about structs, from the very basics to
some advanced patterns I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way.</p>
