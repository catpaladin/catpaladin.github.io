        <p>Hello, Gophers! Welcome to Part 2 of Data Structures and Algorithms. If you&rsquo;ve missed
Part 1 on Big O, you can read it
<a href="https://blog.mikesahari.com/posts/dsa-part1-big-o/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Data structures form the foundation of computer science—they&rsquo;re how we organize, store,
and manipulate information in ways that mirror how we think and solve problems. Far
beyond mere implementation details, these abstractions shape how we conceptualize
computational challenges. Whether you&rsquo;re building a search engine indexing billions of
webpages, an operating system managing memory resources, or a mobile app tracking user
interactions, choosing the right data structure can mean the difference between a
solution that scales gracefully and one that becomes that legacy tech debt app that
engineers share stories about, blaming the original designer (you know who you are).</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying teaching fundamentals in Go, recently. If you haven&rsquo;t read any
of my other blogs or are new to go, I strongly recommend checking out my
<a href="https://blog.mikesahari.com/tags/fundamentals/">fundamentals</a> posts. I started this
blog as a next step, and before I knew it I was writing something way too long to share.
This will be the first part of a blog series on data structures and algorithms; and of
course, in Go!</p>

        <p>If you&rsquo;ve been diving into Go programming (or &ldquo;Golang&rdquo; as the cool kids say), you&rsquo;ve definitely encountered structs. They&rsquo;re absolutely fundamental to how we organize and work with data in Go, and mastering them is crucial to writing clean, efficient Go code.</p>
<p>I like to teach about structs, like other fundamentals, because of how powerful structs can be when used properly. Let&rsquo;s break down everything you need to know about structs, from the very basics to some advanced patterns I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a handful of personal webdev Go projects, and the one thing I could never wrap my head around was <a href="https://github.com/a-h/templ">Templ</a>. I would start the project and go, &ldquo;Oh no. I need a UI for this. Not everything can be made into a TUI&hellip; or can it..&rdquo;. This would lead me to looking at the Templ docs, not understanding how to implement it, and either use the embed package (I LOVE <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/embed">embed</a>!) or starting a TypeScript frontend, creating a bunch of tsx files and coming to the sudden realization that I gave in to React.</p>

        <p>I still remember the moment it clicked. I was knee-deep in refactoring a Go CLI (<em>weekend project</em>) for unit testing with mocks, which had become a tangled mess of dependencies when suddenly – 🤯 – the elegance of Go&rsquo;s interface system hit me like a revelation.</p>
<p>It has been many years, but I remember programming in C#; where interfaces were verbose constructs that required explicit declarations and implementation hierarchies. But here was Go, silently composing functionality in a way that felt almost magical.</p>

        <p>Let&rsquo;s get real about pointers in Go—they&rsquo;re not the scary beasts you might remember from C (if you came from that CS background).

        <p>Hello fellow Gophers!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely thrilled to dive deep into one of Go&rsquo;s most elegant features: <strong>Channels</strong>! If you&rsquo;re just starting your Go journey or looking to level up your concurrency game, you&rsquo;re in for a treat.</p>
<p>Channels are the communication mechanism that makes goroutines work together efficiently and safely. They enable goroutines to exchange data without shared memory, reducing the risk of race conditions.</p>

        <p>I was inspired to write this article after a recent discussion about programming language preferences, specifically questioning my stance on Python. Let me start by acknowledging Python&rsquo;s strengths - it excels in machine learning and generative AI applications. However, I <strong>prefer</strong> Go for several compelling reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory management with pointers</li>
<li>Elegant concurrency using channels and goroutines</li>
<li>Straightforward cross-compilation of binaries</li>
<li>Clean implementation of interfaces and structs</li>
</ul>
<p>But preferences often face challenges. Some argue, &ldquo;Python now has concurrency, so you should switch to Python.&rdquo; I fundamentally disagree with this reasoning. Developers should write code in languages they enjoy and find productive. In professional settings, use your preferred language until organizational standards dictate otherwise (i.e. Thou shalt use only thy golden hammer language of the team).</p>
