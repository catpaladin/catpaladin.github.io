&lt;p>&lt;em>Hey there, fellow Go enthusiasts! Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to share something that completely changed my CLI development game. Buckle up â€“ we&amp;rsquo;re diving deep into making CLIs that users will actually enjoy using!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-cli-development-evolution">The CLI Development Evolution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You know how we all instinctively reach for &lt;a href="https://github.com/spf13/cobra">cobra&lt;/a> when building command-line tools in Go? Well, here is the perfect companion that&amp;rsquo;s transformed how I think about CLI interactions: &lt;a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh">huh&lt;/a> by Charmbracelet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://catpaladin.github.io/images/huh-cat.gif" alt="huh" title="huh">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing that got me excited:&lt;/em> While &lt;code>cobra&lt;/code> handles all the heavy lifting of command structure and flags (and does it beautifully, I might add), &lt;code>huh&lt;/code> brings something entirely different to the table. It&amp;rsquo;s all about creating those smooth, interactive forms and prompts that make your CLIs feel professional and polished. Think of it as the difference between a bare-bones terminal app and something that feels like it belongs in 2025.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
