        <p><em>Hey there, fellow Go enthusiasts! Today, I&rsquo;m going to share something that completely changed my CLI development game. Buckle up â€“ we&rsquo;re diving deep into making CLIs that users will actually enjoy using!</em></p>
<h2 id="the-cli-development-evolution">The CLI Development Evolution</h2>
<p>You know how we all instinctively reach for <a href="https://github.com/spf13/cobra">cobra</a> when building command-line tools in Go?

<p><em>Here&rsquo;s the thing that got me excited:</em> While <code>cobra</code> handles all the heavy lifting of command structure and flags (and does it beautifully, I might add), <code>huh</code> brings something entirely different to the table. It&rsquo;s all about creating those smooth, interactive forms and prompts that make your CLIs feel professional and polished. Think of it as the difference between a bare-bones terminal app and something that feels like it belongs in 2025.</p>
