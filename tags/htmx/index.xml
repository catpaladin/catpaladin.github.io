<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a handful of personal webdev Go projects, and the one thing I could never wrap my head around was <a href="https://github.com/a-h/templ">Templ</a>. I would start the project and go, &ldquo;Oh no. I need a UI for this. Not everything can be made into a TUI&hellip; or can it..&rdquo;. This would lead me to looking at the Templ docs, not understanding how to implement it, and either use the embed package (I LOVE <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/embed">embed</a>!) or starting a TypeScript frontend, creating a bunch of tsx files and coming to the sudden realization that I gave in to React.</p>

        <p>Hello readers. Welcome to my blog!</p>
<p>I was debating on if I would write out a full post for this initial one (to test, you know?).
Instead, I decided to go through my collection of notes and found a topic to post; Go &amp; <a href="https://htmx.org/docs/#introduction">htmx</a>.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;d like to learn more about me, check out my <a href="https://blog.mikesahari.com/about/">about</a> page.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When building modern web applications, we often seek solutions that combine the robustness of server-side programming with the interactivity of client-side applications. Today, I&rsquo;m excited to share my experience working with Go and HTMX, a powerful combination that achieves exactly this balance.</p>
