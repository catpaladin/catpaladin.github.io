        <p>If you&rsquo;re using AI code assistance, you&rsquo;re likely familiar with Ollama. You might have heard about
coding with Ollama, reducing or even removing your plans with AI providers to run models locally;
this keeps your wallet and data safer.</p>
<p>Most people who talk about local models either have access to powerful home labs, high-end data
centers, or the financial means to buy a top-tier GPU. Running even a small model with 40B
parameters reliably requires serious hardware; something not everyone can afford. That’s why Ollama
Cloud stands out. It lets you run large open source AI models (with hourly, weekly, and monthly
limits at a price).</p>

        <p>Coding assistants are all over the place; at least at the time of writing this. Some of them require
you to LOCK IN to their service. Others extend to a limited amount of providers. And then there&rsquo;s
VSCode&hellip; just kidding, it&rsquo;s alright, but I prefer Neovim (I use neovim btw). Last month (relative
to the time of writing this), I was intrigued and reading into improvements in local LLMs; big
improvements to tiny and small models! That led me on a search for a coding assistant that supported
running local LLMs, but in Neovim. Enter, OpenCode.</p>
